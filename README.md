# WIP
This code is a work in progress and thus has no documentation. If you are intrested I suggest you look at:
- RichNN
- examples/xor.c

## Todo:
- [ ] Using Back Propagation instead of Finite Difference
- [ ] Optimisers: Stochastic GD, SGD with Momentum etc..
- [ ] Batch Processing
- [ ] Cleaner API
- [ ] Releasing and Licensing
- [ ] Visualisation of the Network
