# WIP
This code is a work in progress and thus has no documentation. If you are interested, I suggest you look at:
- RichML
- examples/xor.c

## Todo:
- [ ] Refactoring Cost and GD functions - changing how we define input
- [ ] Using Back Propagation instead of Finite Difference
- [ ] Optimisers: Stochastic GD, SGD with Momentum etc..
- [ ] Batch Processing
- [ ] Cleaner API
